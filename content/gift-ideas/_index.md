If you want to get me a gift, I would suggest buying something for a kid, instead.
They need it more than I do. But if you **really** insist on getting me something,
here are some ideas:

* Date night for me & Val. Bonus points if the kids are accommodated!
* Coffee
  * [Ladro Espresso][1] is my regular, if you want a safe choice.
  * I have a good coffee grinder, I much prefer whole bean coffee.
  * I love trying new coffees!
    * I generally dislike smoky and earthy flavors.
    * I like chocolate, caramel, and fruity flavors.
* Coffee gear
  * A mug
  * Quality shot glasses
  * Something to aid in espresso preparation; this probably requires a good bit of research.
    * I have the [ECM Synchronika][2] which uses a standard 58mm portafilter
    * [ESPCUP][3]
    * A fashionable tamper; maybe with calibrated pressure or automatic leveling
  * A [Chemex][4] carafe
* Beer
  * I like all kinds, but IPAs are a favorite.
  * Like coffee, I dislike generally dislike smoky and earthy flavors.
  * Lately I enjoy good non-alcohlic beer more and more.
* Home decorations
  * Posters for topics of interest (and perhaps a frame?)
    * Coffee
    * Dark Souls
    * My Hero Academia -- All Might
    * Dragon Ball -- Vegeta
    * Octopath Traveler -- Olberic
  * Nanoleaf panels
* 9mm Luger ammo
  * Brass casing only (many ranges disallow steel cased ammo).
  * No remanufactured or reloaded ammo (improperly remanufactured ammo can be dangerous).
  * Full metal jacket (FMJ) is cheap and suitable for recreational shooting.
  * Check out [AmmoSeek][5] for good prices.
* A pair of fashionable tactical pants; see [5.11 Pants][6] for ideas.
  * [Defender Flex Straight Jeans][7] look nice.
* An everyday carry (EDC) belt, e.g. from [KORE][8].
* A gift card for [Steam][9].
* A board game to play with the family or friends.
  * I have Settlers of Catan and quite a few expansions already.
  * I like games that have some complexity and strategy to them.
* A [Honeywell furnace air filter][10]: 20x25x4. Yes, really. These things are more expensive than they should be.

## Things to Avoid ##

Anything below is something that I'd want to spend a lot of time researching for
myself before deciding on. For that reason, these things should probably be avoided.

* Tools
* Shooting gear
* Computer parts
