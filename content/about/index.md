title: About Me
draft: false
---

My name is John, though often I go by "JK". I am a born and raised Minnesota native
living in the west Twin Cities metro area. I've been here my whole life.

I have had the privilege of working in many facets of technology throughout my
career: software development, Linux systems administration, network security,
digital forensics, enterprise storage, and site reliability, among others.
Presently, I work for [AerisWeather][1] where my chief responsibilities are
overseeing cloud infrastructure and maintaining our [webhooks][2] product.

Dialing in a shot of espresso and mastering the art of the pour over bring
me joy. I'm also fond of technical side projects, where I am free
to prioritize engineering excellence. You may also find me drafting a
[blog][3] post, playing video games, working on various home improvement projects,
or just spending time with my lovely partner, Val, and my cat baby, Darla.

If you're an old friend or someone looking for some light consulting,
please [reach out][4]. I would love to hear from you.
