My name is John, though often I go by "JK". I am a born and raised Minnesota native
living in the west Twin Cities metro area. I've been here my whole life.

I have had the privilege of working in many facets of technology throughout my
career: software development, Linux systems administration, network security,
digital forensics, enterprise storage, and site reliability, among others.
Presently, I serve as a Lead Infrastructure Engineer at [BigCommerce][1].

Dialing in a shot of espresso and mastering the art of the pour over bring
me joy. I'm also fond of technical side projects, where I am free
to prioritize engineering excellence. You may also find me drafting a
[blog][2] post, playing video games, working on various home improvement
projects or spending time with my family.

If you're an old friend or someone looking for some light consulting,
please [reach out][3]. I would love to hear from you.
